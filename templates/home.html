                    <h1 class="font-monospace" style="color: #ebc33a;">Launch an online Nmap Port Scan in 3 simple Steps :</h1>
                    <p class="font-monospace text-start home_setup_p" style="color: #f3f5f8;"><br><br><strong>Step 1. &nbsp;Create a LinuxToolBox account </strong><br><br>A <strong>LinuxToolBox</strong> Account gives you access to our Tools. With a LinuxToolBox Account, you can do things like:<br>• Access Nmap online port scanner&nbsp;<br>• Get a sample results from Nmap scanner<br><br> <strong>Step 2. &nbsp;Fill out the form, entering the address or hostname of the target(s)</strong><br><br>Enter a <strong>public IP address</strong> or hostname that is accessible from an external Internet facing perspective.&nbsp;<span style="color: red;">you must have premission</span>&nbsp;to scan the target. Online Nmap port scans can also be performed against a list of valid target addresses, simply include the targets <strong>comma separated</strong> or <strong>as a list</strong> with line breaks.<br><br><span style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;/*justify-content: space-between;*/gap: 100px;">Scan a single IP address or Hostname<br>Example:<br>192.168.1.1<br>example.com<br><br><span>Scan a range of IP addresses<br>Example:<br>192.168.1.0/24<br>192.168.1.1-50</span></span><br><br>By selecting the <strong>Combine Report</strong> option members can elect to receive a single report which includes a summary table of the multiple NMAP targets requested, and the full results all presented in a single file.<br><br><strong>Step 2. &nbsp;Decide on which Ports you wish to Scan</strong><br><br>Select the port option based on standard Nmap options; <strong>Default, Fast</strong> scan or <strong>Scan All</strong> 65535 ports on an IP Address. Scanning all ports is the most accurate way to discover every listening service. A full scan with all ports is required for a comprehensive test of a firewall configuration. Note that a full scan can take from 20 minutes to a couple of hours depending on the network.<br>Also available is scanning of <strong>common UDP </strong>ports, as well a <strong>custom port</strong> configuration option where you may select a subset of specific ports (udp or tcp).<br><br><strong>Optional configuration can be specified</strong><br><br>• Default protocol is IPv4, select the Protocol option to enable IPv6 (nmap option -6)<br>• Ping is performed by default to ensure system is responding, select option to disable the ping (nmap option -Pn)<br>• Enable OS Detection to probe the Operating System version (nmap option -O)<br>• Perform an optional Traceroute uses results from the port scan to find the most accurate method (nmap option --traceroute)<br><br><strong>Step 3: The Final Step is to Simply Launch the Port Scan</strong><br><br>Actual scan times will vary greatly depending on the target network and number of ports being scanned.<br><br>Nmap results are delivered to your registered email address once the port scan is completed. Results are also available in the <strong>Members Dashboard</strong> for download. Improve your <strong>security reporting</strong> workflow with an easy to use <strong>export to XLSX </strong>option for all open ports. <strong>Generate summary reports</strong> across multiple scan profiles and/or networks.<br><br><strong>Sample Results from Nmap Online</strong><br><br>The default settings will perform the port scan using a TCP SYN based test. This is a standard Nmap port scan (-sS) with version detection enabled (nmap -sV). Any other selected optional parameters will be included.<br>The results are emailed to the users registered email address. Scan results are available as plain text and HTML formats.<br><br></p>
